Setting Up Your ChatGPT with Custom PDF Data Using LangChain

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for building a chatbot system that incorporates custom PDF data using LangChain. It explains how to upload PDF files, convert them into text, and leverage the text to generate embeddings for semantic search within a vector database. By utilizing a large language model, this system supports chat completion and can be adapted with various models and libraries.

Key Features
- PDF Upload: Enables users to upload PDFs, which are processed and converted into text for further analysis.
- semantic Search: Text from the PDFs is used to create embeddings, facilitating efficient semantic search through a vector database.
- Customization: The system can be customized with different models and libraries to meet specific requirements.
- Vector Store Creation: Demonstrates how to build a vector store from text chunks, using embeddings and FAISS for quick retrieval.
- Conversational Chain: Establishes a conversation chain to handle user interactions seamlessly.
- Information Extraction: The system extracts relevant information from documents in response to user queries.
- Use Cases: Highlights potential applications, such as extracting insights from extensive PDFs or creating tailored chatbots based on specific datasets.

Prerequisites
Ensure that the following prerequisites are installed before starting:
- Python 3.x
- LangChain framework
- OpenAI GPT-3 or an alternative large language model
- FAISS library for efficient similarity searching
